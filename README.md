Animations v1.3
===============

A versatile CSS3 animation pack with various usages. Trigger CSS3 animations as elements enter the viewport, as you hover with a mouse or by binding them via JavaScript functions/event listeners.

**Demo:** http://www.cloud-eight.com/github/animations/


Usage
=====

<ul>
  <li>Use the IE conditional statements with your `html` tags shown below</li>
  <li>Link both animations.min.css and animations.min.js to your document</li>
  <li>Follow the guides below depending on what aspect of the plugin you wish to use</li>
</ul>


Animations
==========

The plugin will auto detect elements in view on page load, any other element assigned with the `animate` class and a `data-anim-type` attribute will be executed as it enters the viewport upon scrolling.

<ul>
  <li>Add the class `no-js` to your `html` tag also</li>
  <li>Add the class `animate` to the desired element</li>
  <li>Add the attribute `data-anim-type` with an animation type listed below</li>
  <li>(Optional) Add the attribute `data-anim-delay` if you wish to put a delay (in ms) on the animation</li>
</ul>

```
<div class="animate" data-anim-type="bounceIn" data-anim-delay="200">Bouncy Bouncy</div>
```

By default, animation duration time/speed is 1 second, if you wish to adjust this duration you can add the class `slow-mo` (2 seconds), `super-slow-mo` (3 seconds), `ultra-slow-mo` (4 seconds) or `hyper-slow-mo` (5 seconds).

```
<div class="animate slow-mo" data-anim-type="bounceIn" data-anim-delay="200">Bouncy Bouncy</div>
<div class="animate super-slow-mo" data-anim-type="bounceIn" data-anim-delay="200">Bouncy Bouncy</div>
<div class="animate ultra-slow-mo" data-anim-type="bounceIn" data-anim-delay="200">Bouncy Bouncy</div>
<div class="animate hyper-slow-mo" data-anim-type="bounceIn" data-anim-delay="200">Bouncy Bouncy</div>
```


Click and Hovers
================

There are 2 types of predefined animated JavaScript functions, 1 that executes the animation once and another which loops continuously/infinitely.
You can pass 2 variables into these functions and that is the ID/Class of the target element and what type of animation you want to execute.
Multiple elements can be targeted by seperating them with a comma.

```
<button onclick="animateOnce('#element', 'wave');">Wave Once</button>
<button onclick="animateInfinite('#element, #tagline', 'wave');">Wave Continuously</button>
```

To stop an element from animating you can use the `animateEnd` function and passing the element ID/Class.

```
<button onclick="endTrigger('#element');">End Wave</button>
```

You can also use the `hover-*` class to assign the animation to the `:hover` psuedo selector, adding the class `infinite` will continuously loop the animation while hovering.

```
<button class="hover-spin">Spin Once</button>
<button class="hover-spin infinite">Spin Continuously</button>
```

Progress Bars
=============

Using progress bars requires a simple HTML markup and a few select class names.
It also uses the [Flat UI Color Scheme](http://flatuicolors.com/) to help style the progress bars, if color classes aren't provided it uses a default grey color scheme.
There are 2 data attributes you must specify `data-progress-bar-percent` is how far the bar will animate to and `data-progress-bar-delay` works the same way as `data-anim-delay` when animating elements.
Since it relies on jQuery to animate the bars length from 0 to 'x', applying the class `bar-*` to the `progress-bar` element works as a CSS fallback.

```
<div class="progress-bar-container color-nephriti">
  <div class="progress-bar bar-50 color-emerald" data-progress-bar-percent="50" data-progress-bar-delay="100">
    <div class="progress-bar-candy"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

By default, the candy stripe is static, to animate the stripes left or right, apply either the `candy-ltr` or `candy-rtl` class on the `progress-bar-candy` element.
To remove the candy stripes, simply remove the `progress-bar-candy` element to leave a solid progress bar.


Browser Compatibility
=====================

<ul>
  <li>IE 10+</li>
  <li>Firefox 25+</li>
  <li>Chrome 31+</li>
  <li>Safari 7+</li>
  <li>Opera 18+</li>
  <li>Most mobile browsers</li>
</ul>


Limitations
===========

Since this uses Digital Fusions' visible plugin to animate elements as they enter the viewport, the same limitations apply to this plugin also, in that it will not check for visibility in nested scrollable areas, only on the main viewport (window object).
Animations executing on elements entering the viewport will not work if JavaScript is disabled.
Animations are currently limited to devices with a viewport of 960px (wide) and higher.
